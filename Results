### Customer Segmentation Visualization

### Key Insights

- **Segment 1 (High-Value Customers)**: This segment consists of customers with high Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores, indicating they are frequent buyers who spend a significant amount. Targeted marketing efforts towards this segment can help increase customer loyalty and drive higher revenue.

- **Segment 2 (Potential Loyal Customers)**: These customers have high Frequency and Monetary scores but lower Recency scores, suggesting they may be drifting away. Implementing retention strategies, such as personalized offers or loyalty programs, can help re-engage them and turn them into loyal customers.

- **Segment 3 (Low-Value Customers)**: This segment comprises customers with low Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores. While they may not contribute significantly to revenue, they still represent potential for growth. Tailored marketing campaigns aimed at incentivizing repeat purchases can help increase their value to the company.

### Recommendations
